RhythmCloud - Learn to play the drums and learn AWS IoT!

This project is broken into its components as follows:

- cloudformation: this sets up IoT, DynamoDB, IAM users, S3 Buckets, and associated keys
- pi: python code that runs locally on the PI
- web: this is the static html files for the web UI
- lambda: lambda functions for UI and Greengrass

For the architecture see the PDF file "docs/RhythmCloudArchitecture.pdf".
For the physical build and software setup instructions see the file "docs/RhythmCloudBuildInstructions.pdf"

Good luck!

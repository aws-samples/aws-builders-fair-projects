These file formats allows for efficient loading of images when training the model. In this example we will be using the Image list format (.lst file). A .lst file is a tab-separated file with three columns that contains a list of image files. The first column specifies the image index, the second column specifies the class label index for the image, and the third column specifies the relative path of the image file. The RecordIO file contains the actual pixel data for the images.\n",
